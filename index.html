        I really loved eating food from bocca cafe, it was truly a heavenly experience.
        <br> I never ate it fresh till now, but that would be amazing!

        <br><br> On the day of 23rd December, 2021, there was a huge online party at school.
        <br> I heard that one or two people said that they were going to a cafe,
        <br>I soon became pretty jealous, I asked my mom if I could eat out too.
        <br> I scrolled for an hour on swiggy, until I found an image of herbed pasta.
        <br> Curious, I ordered it immediately.
        <br><br> Once it arrived, I was so happy!
        <br> It was the best pasta I ever had in my life, thought there wasn't any sauce.
        <br> It was overall a great experience, I highly recommend that restaurant
